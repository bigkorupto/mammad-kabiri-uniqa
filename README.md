# Schilling on the Blockchain! - Public Distributed (Hyper) Ledger - Rock-Solid Alpine Dollar from Austria  


## How does it work?

### Payments in Schilling

If you have Schilling on the blockchain you can send Schilling to anyone. Add a new transaction record to the /inbox folder. For example:

```
from: maria, to: adam, amount: 4
```

### Buy Schilling with Euros / Dollars / Yen / etc.

If you want to buy Schilling in Euro (or Dollar) find someone with Schilling on the blockchain! Try the [next Vienna.js meetup in sektorfuenf](https://meetup.com/viennajs/events/236300243). We will auction off 1000 Schilling! 


### Mine New Schilling

If you want to mine new Schilling - you are welcome. "Clear", that is, audit and double-check the transactions in the /inbox folder with the accounts on the blockchain. Bundle up the transactions (four at a time for now)
in a new block and add it to the blockchain. 
For your work you will get rewarded with newly minted 10 Schilling! Schilling! Schilling! Start mining!
