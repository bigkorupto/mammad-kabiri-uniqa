# The Strange Case of Mammad Kabiri @ Uniqa Software Service

"You are fired!", said the letter delivered by postal mail.
Mammad Kabiri - the Department head and chief of no-container services -
hasn't called since the beginning of the first corona lockdown in March
and the closing of the office.

"Call Mammad Kabiri", said the letter, 
"to return and hand-in the companies' computer."

Three month later in December the company computer is still waiting for pick up
in the home office.
Mammad Kabiri hasn't called yet. Mr. No Call. No Container. No Code.

The reason for getting fired:  "You do NOT respond to phone calls!"

Three month later (on December 21st, 9am) the first phone call from management. Georg Gfrerer - 
the Division head and chief no-code pega bullshiter is on the line.

"You haven't worked for seven months! No code! 
You want us to pay you for three more months as is the law and custom in Austria?
Ha. You're fired!"  

Via back channels I arranged to finally get a fixed date and time (December 21st, 2pm)
to enter the office - under the supervision of two security guards -
to get back my personal belongings (many books, and more) 
and clear out my pre-corona / covid-19 era desk.

Georg Gfrerer continues "Now listen boy, here's the deal. You bring along 
the office computer from your home office and we let you in to get your books."

"No computer. No books. Do you copy?" 

I am about nintey-minute away from the big city and the office tower. 

"Thanks for calling! The deal is - I pick up my books and you pick up your computer - send somebody
you are a big important man."


"No computer. No books. Do you copy? This is private property you're stealing! I send you the police.
Your book pick up is called off", and the call is over.
