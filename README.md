# The Strange Case of Mammad Kabiri @ Uniqa Software Service

"You are fired!", said the letter delivered by postal mail.
Mammad Kabiri - the Department head and chief of no-container services
has'nt called since the beginning of the first corona lockdown in March
and the closing of the office.

"Call Mammad Kabiri", said the letter, 
"to return and hand-in the companies' computer."

Three month later in December the company computer is still waiting for pick up
in the home office.
Mammad Kabiri hasn't called yet. Mr. No Call. No Container. No Code.

The reason for getting fired:  "You do NOT respond to phone calls!"
