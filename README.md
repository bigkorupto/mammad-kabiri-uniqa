(†): Miner Transaction - New Shilling on the Market!


## How does it work?

### Payments in Shilling

If you have Shilling on the blockchain you can send Shilling to anyone. Add a new transaction record to the /inbox folder. For example:

```
from: Maria      to: Adam     amount: 4
```

### Buy Shilling with Euros / Dollars / Yen / etc.

If you want to buy Shilling in Euro (or Dollar) find someone with Shilling on the blockchain! Try the [next Vienna.rb meetup](https://meetup.com/vienna-rb/events/245432241). We will auction off 1000 Shilling!


### Mine New Shilling

If you want to mine new Shilling - you are welcome. "Clear", that is, audit and double-check the transactions in the /inbox folder with the accounts on the blockchain. Bundle up the transactions (four at a time for now)
in a new block and add it to the blockchain.
For your work you will get rewarded with newly minted 10 Shilling! Shilling! Shilling! Start mining!
